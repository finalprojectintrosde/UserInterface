# USER-INTERFACE (WEB-APPLICATION):

https://userinterfacesde.herokuapp.com/

Our project goal was trying to generate sentences and advice that would persuade the user to do more physical activity. The calculation are based on real time data monitoring.
The application is composed by two different System logics, one used in order to generate the motivational sentences based on users and external conditions while the other one is in charge to change the Fitbit goals of the users drawing on the progress or the difficulties encountered by him/her. 

The application lifecycle is based on a random call done every 10 seconds of all the methods present in the two ProcessCentric services devloped.
Other services will be called in order to show the user information.

#Note:
Since at first, we didn't understand how to deliver the report, we wrote in the submit form that this readme would be the description file. Actually this is not the description file but just a little introduction to the project.
The real description file is located in the repository as "Description.docx".
Furthrmore the api documentation of every service is listed on the readme of each repository.
